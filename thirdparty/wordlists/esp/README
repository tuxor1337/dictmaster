drae.txt
--------

According to http://www.rae.es/sites/default/files/Preambulo.pdf, the DRAE
(22th edition) contains 88,431 (23rd ed: 93,111) entries.

The file `words.txt` contains 87,603 words and hence seems to be a good
approximation. When I tried to fetch these words, for about 1,000 terms the
download failed. I found that this is due to the redundancies with
terms (adjectives) like "travieso"/"traviesa", "acostado"/"acostada", ...

The file `drae.txt` contains roughly those 87,000 words from `words.txt` and
`grandic.txt` for which the download did not fail.
